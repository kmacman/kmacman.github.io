### NLP API for extraction of structured data from freetext palliative care consult questions


I developed a rule-based natural language processing tool using MedSpacy which can extract the diagnosis and reason for consult from free-text palliative care consult questions. 

This tool is planned for use as part of our department's push to integrate with the Palliative Care Quality Collaborative, a nation wide database of palliative care programs used for benchmarking and QA/QI initiatives.

The code can be used within Jupyter Notebooks, but for ease of deployment and transportability I also turned it into a dockerized FastAPI and deployed the API to a DigitalOcean Droplet.
