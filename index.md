### NLP API for extraction of main palliative diagnosis and consult reason from freetext consult questions.


I developed a rule-based natural language processing tool using MedSpacy which can extract the diagnosis and reason for consult from a free-text palliative care consult question. 

The code can be used within Jupyter Notebooks, but for ease of deployment and transportability I turned it into a dockerized FastAPI.
